 * OAuthLint research report, single source of truth for every figure on

 *
 * 100% AGGREGATE. This file MUST NOT name, list, link, or otherwise identify
 * any specific repository, organisation, person, or GitHub user, and MUST NOT
 * attribute findings to any specific AI tool. Frame everything as patterns
 * common in AI-generated code in general. The corpus is described only as a
 * category: public repositories self-identifying as AI-generated / vibe-coded
 * applications.
 *
 * Provisional values below, overwrite with the final measured numbers before
 * shipping. The page renders whatever is here faithfully.
