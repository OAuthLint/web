# CLI reference

The `oauthlint` CLI scans your code for OAuth / OIDC / JWT / session / CORS / MCP server auth anti-patterns, lists the shipped rules, captures a baseline, scaffolds a config, diagnoses your install, explains a rule, and probes a running MCP server. Run it with `npx oauthlint <command>`, no install required. It is self-contained: nothing to install and no config. On first run it downloads and checksum-verifies a small pinned scan engine (~41 MB, one time, cached), reusing an installed `opengrep` or `semgrep` if one is on your `PATH`. Point it at a specific binary with `OAUTHLINT_ENGINE` or `--engine <path>`.

## `scan`

Scan a directory for auth misconfigurations.

```bash
npx oauthlint scan [path]
```

The `path` argument is the directory (or file) to scan. It is optional and defaults to `.` (the current directory). You can pass **several paths/files** at once.

```bash
# scan the current directory
npx oauthlint scan

# scan a specific path
npx oauthlint scan ./src

# scan several files (e.g. from a pre-commit hook)
npx oauthlint scan src/auth.ts src/server.ts

# scan only what changed (fast CI + pre-commit)
npx oauthlint scan --diff          # files changed vs the default branch
npx oauthlint scan --staged        # git-staged files only
```

### Flags

| Flag | Values | Default | Description |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--format <fmt>` | `pretty` \| `json` \| `sarif` \| `html` | `pretty` | Output format. `sarif` emits a SARIF report for GitHub Code Scanning; `html` emits a standalone, self-contained HTML report (pipe it to a file, e.g. `> report.html`). |
| `--json` | none | off | Shortcut for `--format json`. When both are set, `--format` wins. |
| `--severity <level>` | `INFO` \| `LOW` \| `MEDIUM` \| `HIGH` \| `CRITICAL` | none | Only emit findings at or above this severity. Filters output; case-insensitive. |
| `--fail-on <level>` | `INFO` \| `LOW` \| `MEDIUM` \| `HIGH` \| `CRITICAL` \| `off` | `HIGH` | Exit non-zero when any finding meets or exceeds this severity. `off` never fails the build. Falls back to `failOn` in your config, then `HIGH`. Case-insensitive. |
| `--rules-dir <path>` | filesystem path | bundled rules | Override the bundled rule pack with a custom rules directory. |
| `--fix` | none | off | Apply auto-fixes, rewriting source in place where a rule ships a safe fix template (the TLS/certificate-verification flag flips for Rust `reqwest` and Go `crypto/tls`, and the Go `http.Cookie` `Secure`/`HttpOnly` flips). Each fix is a deterministic literal replacement; running `--fix` twice is a no-op. After fixing, it prints a summary of which files changed. |
| `--fix-dry-run` | none | off | Preview what `--fix` would change as a unified diff per file, **without writing anything**. Takes precedence over `--fix` when both are given. |
| `--diff [<ref>]` | git ref | merge-base with the default branch | Scan only files changed versus `<ref>`. Great for CI on large repos, since only new code is scanned. Outside a git repo, errors clearly. |
| `--staged` | none | off | Scan only git-staged files. Used by the [pre-commit hook](/docs/pre-commit). |
| `--baseline [<file>]` | path | `.oauthlint-baseline.json` | Suppress findings already recorded in a baseline file and report only **new** findings. Capture the baseline with the [`baseline`](#baseline) command. |
| `--no-update-check` | none | on | Skip the once-a-day check to npm for a newer `oauthlint` version. The check already auto-disables under `--json` / `--format sarif`, in CI, when piped, or when `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` is set. |

A few details worth knowing:

- `--severity` controls **what is printed**; `--fail-on` controls **what fails the build**. They are independent.
- `--severity` and `--fail-on` accept any case (`high`, `HIGH`); an unrecognised value is rejected with an error.
- When a finding ships a safe autofix, the machine-readable formats carry it per finding: `--json` adds an optional `fix` object (`{ replacement, range }`, where `range` has 1-based `startLine`/`startCol`/`endLine`/`endCol` plus 0-based byte `startOffset`/`endOffset`), and `--format sarif` populates the standard SARIF `fixes` array on the result. The field is omitted entirely for findings with no fix, so existing consumers are unaffected. The [VS Code extension](/docs/vscode) uses this to offer a per-finding **Apply fix** action.
- Inline `oauthlint-disable` suppressions are applied before the severity filter. See [Suppressing rules](/docs/suppressing).
- Config-file values (`failOn`, `customRulesDir`, path scoping) are read from `.oauthlintrc.yml` and overridden by the matching flag. See [Configuration](/docs/configuration).

```bash
# only show HIGH and above
npx oauthlint scan ./src --severity HIGH

# machine-readable output
npx oauthlint scan ./src --json

# SARIF for GitHub Code Scanning
npx oauthlint scan ./src --format sarif > oauthlint.sarif

# standalone HTML report to share or attach in CI
npx oauthlint scan ./src --format html > report.html

# report only NEW findings against a captured baseline
npx oauthlint scan ./src --baseline

# never fail the build (CI dry-run)
npx oauthlint scan ./src --fail-on off

# preview the safe fixes as a diff, without touching any files
npx oauthlint scan ./src --fix-dry-run

# auto-apply safe fixes (idempotent; prints a summary of changed files)
npx oauthlint scan ./src --fix
```

## `list`

List every rule the current install ships with. Pretty output shows severity, an `LLM↑` marker for rules with high LLM prevalence, the rule id and its OAuthLint id.

The pack is more than pattern matches: it also ships **dataflow (taint) rules** that track untrusted input to a dangerous sink. That covers open-redirect and SSRF detection across JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Java and Rust, so it catches issues a syntactic pattern would miss.

```bash
# pretty listing
npx oauthlint list

# machine-readable
npx oauthlint list --json
```

Browse the same catalogue with vulnerable/safe examples and CWE/OWASP mappings in the [rules catalogue](/rules).

## `baseline`

Scan the codebase and write a baseline of the current findings. This is how you adopt OAuthLint on an existing project without fixing everything first: capture today's findings, then have future scans report only **new** ones.

```bash
# capture the current findings to .oauthlint-baseline.json
npx oauthlint baseline

# choose where the baseline is written
npx oauthlint baseline ./src --output .oauthlint-baseline.json
```

Once a baseline exists, run `scan --baseline` (which reads `.oauthlint-baseline.json` by default) and only findings absent from the baseline are reported. That's ideal for gating CI on newly introduced issues while you work the backlog down separately.

## `init`

Generate a `.oauthlintrc.yml` in the current directory. Refuses to overwrite an existing file unless you pass `-f` / `--force`.

```bash
# scaffold a config
npx oauthlint init

# overwrite an existing config
npx oauthlint init --force
```

See [Configuration](/docs/configuration) for the full file format.

## `doctor`

Diagnose your OAuthLint install. It checks the Node.js runtime (≥ v20), resolves the scan engine (reporting whether it was found on `PATH`, downloaded, or set via `OAUTHLINT_ENGINE`/`--engine`), and confirms the rule pack loads.

```bash
# pretty environment check
npx oauthlint doctor

# machine-readable
npx oauthlint doctor --json
```

## `probe`

Probe a running MCP server for OAuth 2.1 resource-server conformance. Unlike `scan`, which reads your source, `probe` tests a live server's deployed behaviour. It is credential-free: every check is a negative test (unauthenticated and invalid-token requests) plus RFC 9728 and authorization-server metadata discovery, so it never needs a token and never writes anything.

```bash
npx oauthlint probe <url>
```

The `<url>` is the endpoint of a running MCP server, for example `https://host/mcp`. It checks that the server requires a token (401 / 403, not 200), that the 401 `WWW-Authenticate` challenge advertises `resource_metadata`, that the Protected Resource Metadata is discoverable at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (RFC 9728) with an absolute https `resource` (RFC 8707), that the authorization server advertises PKCE `S256` and a non-empty `scopes_supported`, and that a bogus bearer token is rejected.

```bash
# probe a deployed server
npx oauthlint probe https://mcp.example.com/mcp

# machine-readable output ({ url, checks })
npx oauthlint probe https://mcp.example.com/mcp --json
```

`probe` exits `1` if any check hard-fails (an unauthenticated endpoint, an accepted invalid token, no Protected Resource Metadata, or PKCE S256 not advertised), and `0` otherwise. An invalid or unreachable URL exits `2`. See [Scanning MCP servers](/docs/mcp-server-auth) for how it pairs with the static MCP rule pack.

## Exit codes

`scan` sets the process exit code so CI can gate on it. A finding only affects the exit code when it meets the `--fail-on` threshold (default `HIGH`).

| Code | When |
|:----:|------|
| `0` | No finding at or above the `--fail-on` threshold (or `--fail-on off`). |
| `1` | A finding meets the threshold and the worst severity present is `HIGH`. |
| `2` | A finding meets the threshold and the worst severity present is `CRITICAL`, **or** the scan output could not be parsed (it never silently exits clean). |
| `127` | No scan engine is available and one could not be downloaded (e.g. offline on first run with no `opengrep`/`semgrep` installed). |

`list`, `init`, and `doctor` exit `0` on success. `init` exits `1` if the config already exists and `--force` was not passed; `doctor` exits `1` if any check fails.

> Note: because `--fail-on` gates on the threshold but the failing code reflects the *worst severity present*, a run whose worst finding is `MEDIUM` or below exits `0` even with `--fail-on MEDIUM`. To block on lower-severity findings, treat any non-empty `--json` output as a failure in your pipeline.

## CI examples

Fail the build on HIGH-and-above findings:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# No engine to install: the CLI downloads and checksum-verifies a pinned
# Opengrep on first run (cache it between builds to skip the one-time download).
npx oauthlint scan ./src --fail-on HIGH
```

Upload SARIF to GitHub Code Scanning so findings annotate the PR:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# --fail-on off so the SARIF upload step still runs even when findings exist
npx oauthlint scan ./src --format sarif --fail-on off > oauthlint.sarif
```

For a turnkey GitHub workflow that runs the scan and uploads SARIF, use the [GitHub Action](/docs/github-action).
