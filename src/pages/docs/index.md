# Getting started

OAuthLint scans your code for the OAuth 2.0 / OIDC / JWT / session / cookie / CORS / TLS / secrets / MCP server auth anti-patterns that AI coding tools ship by default. It covers eleven languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, and more) plus mobile auth (Swift/iOS, Android), and flags each finding with a fix, before the code reaches a pull request.

## Run your first scan

No install, no config, no account. Point it at your source:

```bash
npx oauthlint scan ./src
```

It scans the directory, prints every finding it's confident about, and exits non-zero if anything fired. On clean, idiomatic auth code it stays silent, which is the whole point.

## Read a finding

Each finding is one line of signal:

```
CRITICAL  auth.jwt.no-verification  src/auth/session.ts:42
  Decoding a JWT does not verify its signature, so claims.sub can be forged.
  ✓ Fix: jwt.verify(token, key, { algorithms: ['RS256'] })
```

- **Severity**: `critical` · `high` · `medium` · `low` · `info`. Use it to decide what blocks CI.
- **Rule id**, for example `auth.jwt.no-verification`. Every rule has a page in the [rules catalogue](/rules) with a vulnerable and a safe example, mapped to CWE/OWASP.
- **Location**: `file:line`, so it's clickable in your terminal and editor.

## Fail CI on real issues

By default `scan` reports everything but only fails on findings. Gate your pipeline by severity:

```bash
# block the build on HIGH severity and above
npx oauthlint scan ./src --fail-on HIGH
```

See every flag in the [CLI reference](/docs/cli).

## Where to run it

OAuthLint meets your code where it already lives:

- **CLI / CI**: `npx oauthlint scan`, locally or in any pipeline. → [CLI reference](/docs/cli)
- **GitHub Action**: PR annotations and SARIF upload to GitHub code scanning. It's Docker-based, so it runs for any language. → [GitHub Action](/docs/github-action)
- **Your editor (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and more)**: inline diagnostics as you type, with Quick Fix suppressions. The extension ships via OpenVSX too, so it runs in other VS Code forks and agentic editors. → [VS Code extension](/docs/vscode)
- **AI coding tools**: an MCP server so Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf and others scan the auth code they generate, in the loop. → [MCP server](/docs/mcp)
- **Building MCP servers**: a rule pack for OAuth 2.1 resource-server mistakes (token pass-through, missing audience binding, unauthenticated transports, tool-handler SSRF) plus a live `probe` command. → [Scanning MCP servers](/docs/mcp-server-auth)
- **Infrastructure as code**: a rule pack for the auth mistakes in Terraform, GitHub Actions YAML, and AWS IAM trust JSON (wildcard OIDC trust, implicit-grant OAuth clients, insecure callbacks, hard-coded secrets). → [Scanning IaC auth](/docs/iac-auth)

## Tune it to your project

- **[Configuration](/docs/configuration)**: pin a severity floor, scope paths, and toggle rules with an `.oauthlintrc.yml`.
- **[Suppressing rules](/docs/suppressing)**: silence a single line with an auditable inline comment when you've made a deliberate exception.

> New here? Run `npx oauthlint scan ./src` on a real project first. The output is the fastest way to understand what OAuthLint catches.
